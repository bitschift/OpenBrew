\section{Introduction}
% Perhaps get rid of these subsection titles, and just combine it into one larger section with appropriate paragraph spacings.
% These talk about the Purpose, scope, etc, of this paper.
\subsection{Purpose}
\subsection{Scope}
\subsection{Context}
\subsection{Summary}

\section{Glossary}

\section{Stakeholders and Design Concerns}
% Here we list out the design concerns of stakeholders (users, etc...) that we address in this document.
% By laying out the design concerns now, we can address each in turn in the subsequent design sections.

\section{Design Viewpoints}
% Details each design point we choose for this project.
% The tech review had 3 technologies, with 3 choices/investigations for each tech.
% Each of the three technologies chosen should be designed in detail in its own "viewpoint".
% each viewpoint then has its own "view". There can be more than one of these.
% the views describe the specific implementations that each viewpoint covers. Refer to the doc for more info.

\subsection{Abstract Learning from Previous Trials} %connor's
\subsubsection{Learning Algorithm} % Replace with design viewpoint name.
% talk about what algorithm I chose.
% Any design considerations that this algorithm requires
% design of this piece, in the context of the project

\subsubsection{Decision Making Structures}

\subsubsection{Library Implementations}

\subsubsection{Overall Learning Structure}
% diagram showing the interaction between the three previous viewpoints
