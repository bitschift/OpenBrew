\section{Introduction}
% Perhaps get rid of these subsection titles, and just combine it into one larger section with appropriate paragraph spacings.
% These talk about the Purpose, scope, etc, of this paper.
\subsection{Purpose}
This document describes the architecture and design of the brew.ai project.
It conforms to the IEEE 1016 System Design Document specification, and lays out the design of hardware, learning, and android interfaces for the project.

\subsection{Scope}
Stated generally, brew.ai is a device which automatically brews fermented drinks and improves its performance over time based on user feedback.
This allows for users

\subsection{Overview}


\section{Glossary}

\section{Stakeholders and Design Concerns}
% Here we list out the design concerns of stakeholders (users, etc...) that we address in this document.
% By laying out the design concerns now, we can address each in turn in the subsequent design sections.

\section{System Overview}

\section{Design Viewpoints}
% Details each design point we choose for this project.
% The tech review had 3 technologies, with 3 choices/investigations for each tech.
% Each of the three technologies chosen should be designed in detail in its own "viewpoint".
% each viewpoint then has its own "view". There can be more than one of these.
% the views describe the specific implementations that each viewpoint covers. Refer to the doc for more info.

\subsection{Abstract Learning from Previous Trials} %connor's
From the inception, a major component of this project is the idea that it can learn from mistakes and experiments, and improve the quality of the brew over time.
This section looks at the system design from the viewpoint of artificial intelligence creation.
From this perspective, all other design choices of the project are abstracted into general data sources and sinks.
To further illustrate this point, the view Impact on Other Designs, in Section~\ref{sec:AIImpact}, will introduce the reader to this viewpoint by describing its view of the rest of the system.
From there, the AI system's internal view of the brew.ai system will be explained and designed.

\subsubsection{Impact on Other Designs}\label{sec:AIImpact}
From the viewpoint of learning, the two other major viewpoints, electronic hardware and user interfaces, have little to no impact upon the operations of the system.
There will be interaction between these viewpoints, but that does not imply the other sections will autonomously impact the operation of the system.

From the AI perspective, the system is built as a thinking agent, with the ability to send and receive signals.
This allows the agent to change the world it sees (input signals) through its actions (sent signals).
The hardware will be the main component the AI will interact with, as it provides information about the world through sensors, and can change the world through its actuators.
From this perspective, the hardware is generalized into the two categories: sensors and actuators.
This is a common view for an agent to take in regards to its interaction with the world~\cite{RussellNorvig}.
A diagram summarizing the agent's view of the system is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:AIsystemDesign}.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

The agent will also view the user interface as source of actuators and sensors, but this will be limited in scope.
The main task of the agent is to brew drinks, not report information to the user.
Therefore, the main decision-making processes will focus on the hardware interaction (reading sensor values, changing temperature levels, etc.) and not on intelligent interaction with the user.
The direct interaction between the user and the AI will be limited to sending statistical information for display, and basic controls such as start-stop controls.

A standard communication layer will be necessary to communicate between the AI, hardware, and interface.
This will be implemented with standard protocols and library packages, such as JSON for interface communication, and byte streams for hardware interaction.
Builtin Python libraries exist for these communication protocols, and subsequently will be used.

\subsubsection{Decision Making Structures}
An important aspect of intelligent decision making is the computational structure which allows for decisions to be made.
Neural networks are a classic method of non-linear function approximation which
