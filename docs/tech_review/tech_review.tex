\section{Overview}
This document provides a technical review of three broad topics within the brew.ai project: hardware, user interface, and machine learning.
Each broad topic will be discussed in its own section, preceded by an introduction by the section author.
After the introduction, a review of the potential technologies will be given.
Each broad topic will be divvied into three or more sub-topics, which will address specific technologies that will be combined to address the broad topic of the section.
Finally, each broad topic will have a recommendation about which specific technologies should be used.

\subsection{Introduction}
While a vague title, this section investigaes one of the defining features of brew.ai.
In order to create an automated brewing system that not only controls the process in an automated fashion, but can learn from mistakes and improve upon the product, a method of artificial intelligence must be used.
There are several parts to the artificial intelligence setup for the brew.ai project.
This section will focus on three main aspects: learning algorithm, decision making structure, and preexisting implementations.
It is important to note that these aspects are not mutually exclusive. 
Decisions made in one section may effect the choices in another section.
However, there is still a large degree of freedom between each section, especially with regards to the preexisting software packages that are available.
