\section{Retrospective}
The retrospective lays out a history of what has happened this development cycle, along with an analysis of our performance this term.
The history is presented first, in Section~\ref{sec:weekSummaries}, with summaries of our progress each week.
Analysis, presented in a table format in Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, with columns on positives, deltas, and actions.

\subsection{Week Summaries}\label{sec:weekSummaries}
This section outlines our progress from week to week.
Each week is numbered via its position in the academic term.
The summaries are presented in a weekly format, with each week presenting a summary of our performance.
This summary is compiled from our individual weekly updates into one single summary for the week. % Change this if need be, if the other format works better

\subsubsection{Weeks 1 and 2}
During this section of the class, projects were presented by their respective sponsors, and groups were chosen.
As we had already picked a project topic and found a sponsor, this section did not see much progress, apart from orienting ourselves with the class schedule.
