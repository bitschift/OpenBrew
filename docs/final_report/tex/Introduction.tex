\section{Introduction}
The brew.ai project was a senior design project for the 2016-2017 academic year. Its purpose is to create a prototype device which would automatically brew for the user; why do things manually when we can have a computer do it for us? And since we are using a computer to control the brewing, we would like to use modern machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to make a robot that learns how to brew to my tastes.

The initial concept was though of by the three team members, Connor, Aravind, and Cody one summer afternoon in 2016. From there, we drafted a proposal for Dale McCauley in the College of Business. We had heard from the EECS capstone teachers that he was interested in sponsoring a project during this year. After meeting, we agreed to go forward with the project. Dale advised us in a supervisory role, not as a part of the development team.
