There were only two sites that really helped me with this process: Stack Overflow and the Android documentation.
Finding information about implementing Bluetooth on a Raspberry Pi was the biggest hassle of the project.
I initially started using an HID Bluetooth dongle, so I looked through the man pages to find out how to use it, but ended up finding out that it had a kernel bug that caused it to malfunction.
I found information to enable normal HCI Bluetooth from a blog post about connecting an Android phone to a Raspberry Pi.
This blog post is on blog.davidvassallo.me.
The order of usefulness is Stack Overflow, Android Documentation, and blog.davidvassallo.me.
The blog is last since it solves a very specific problem, while the others helped with many other problems.
