\section{How the Tech Changed}
The major difference was the change from the Teensy microcontroller for hardware control to using a Raspberry Pi B+. This change
allowed for a shift in hardware controller code from embedded C to python.
Besides removing the microcontroller from the design, nothing changed about the technology used.
The learning algorithm, the sensors and actuators, and the android interface remained consistent with the original choices..
