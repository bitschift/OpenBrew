\section{Introduction}

Who requested it?
Why was it requested?
What is its importance?
Who was/were your client(s)?
Who are the members of your team?
What were their roles?
What was the role of the client(s)? (I.e., did they supervise only, or did they participate in doing development)



\section{Client Requirements}
\include{./tex/client_requirements/client_requirements.tex}
\section{Difference Between Final Product and Client Requirements}



The Client Requirements document was not modified at all during the year, even as we changed the design.
We did however, fail to complete some of the business related requirements from the original document.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ lll p{0.3\linewidth} }
 \# & Requirement & What happened to it? & Comments \\
\hline
 1 & Microcontroller & Deemed unnecessary and removed from design. & Actuators and sensors  were integrated directly into the Raspberry Pi \\ 
 2 & Business Requirements & Incomplete. & Only the interviews were conducted. \\  
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{Design Document}
\include{./tex/design_document/design_document.tex}

\section{How the Design Changed}

During development it was determined that the microcontroller was unnecessary and that the sensors can interface directly with the Raspberry Pi.
This simplified the design and centralized device functionality to the Raspberry Pi.

\section{Tech Review}
\include{./tex/tech_review/tech_review.tex}

\section{How the Tech Changed}
Besides removing the microcontroller from the design, not much really changed about the technology used.
The learning algorithm, the sensors and actuators, and the android interface pretty much stayed the same.

\section{brew.ai Documentation}

\section{Tech Information Sources}
\subsection{Cody Holliday}
There were only two sites that really helped me with this process: stack overflow and the Android documentation.
Finding information about implementing Bluetooth on a Raspberry Pi was the biggest hassle of the project.
I initially started using an HID Bluetooth dongle, so I looked through the man pages to find out how to use it, but ended up finding out that it had a kernel bug that caused it to malfunction.
I found information to enable normal HCI Bluetooth from a blog post about connecting an Android phone to a Raspberry Pi.
This blog post is on blog.davidvassallo.me.
The order of usefulness is Stack Overflow, Android Documentation, and blog.davidvassallo.me.
The blog is last since it solves a very specific problem, while the others helped with many other problems.

\section{What Did We Learn?}
\subsection{Cody Holliday}
I think overall, I learned how to learn. This year was a struggle for me because I had to push myself to be an independent worker.
I have worked on an independent project before, but I was terrible at it.
I didn't know how to do anything, and I didn't have the drive to learn independently. 
I relied heavily on other people to help me with my work.
But going through Senior Design has really shown me how to manage my time and how to have the drive to work independently.
Working in teams was nothing new to me. However, I did learn how to effectively be part of a team.
That's not something that can be taught outside of a class like this, since most only last ten weeks.
The technical information I learned was not too different than what I learned before.
Sockets and basic programming were normal to me. What was different was enabling Bluetooth on the Pi and learning how activities worked on Android.
Throughout this year I have learned more and more about Linux and how kernel modules work.
Working with Bluetooth allowed me to put some of that knowledge to work.
In much the same way, learning about Android activities and fragments allowed me to use what I learned from my software engineering courses.
The Android activity is like a process. It's big, hefty, and has a lot of functionality.
Fragments are sort of like smaller activities. Their main purpose is to reuse parts of an Android activity to save memory and storage.
If I could do the whole project over again, I would use a framework when developing the app.
I wrote the app in java using Android studio, which is much more difficult than using a framework that does the heavy lifting for you.
That would save so much time and hassle that I would have had to deal with in the later stages of development.
