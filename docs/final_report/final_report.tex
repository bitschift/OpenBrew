\section{Introduction}

Who requested it?
Why was it requested?
What is its importance?
Who was/were your client(s)?
Who are the members of your team?
What were their roles?
What was the role of the client(s)? (I.e., did they supervise only, or did they participate in doing development)



\section{Client Requirements}

\section{Difference Between Final Product and Client Requirements}



The Client Requirements document was not modified at all during the year, even as we changed the design.
We did however, fail to complete some of the business related requirements from the original document.

\begin{tabular}{ lll p{0.3\linewidth} }
 \# & Requirement & What happened to it? & Comments \\
\hline
 1 & Microcontroller & Deemed unnecessary and removed from design. & Actuators and sensors  were integrated directly into the Raspberry Pi \\ 
 2 & Business Requirements & Incomplete. & Only the interviews were conducted. \\  
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{How the Design Changed}

During development it was determined that the microcontroller was unnecessary and that the sensors can interface directly with the Raspberry Pi.
This simplified the design and centralized device functionality to the Raspberry Pi.
