Home brewing is a hobby currently restricted to only the most dedicated, however 
brewing is hopping with potential for expansion into the amateur scene. OpenBrew 
is a framework for homebrewers to incorporate high level artificial intelligence 
into their brewing process, in order to allow amateurs to brew good tasting beer 
or mead without needing to know details of the chemistry involved. The framework 
encompasses micro-electronics hardware (sensors, microcontrollers, and actuators) 
and reinforcement learning based intelligent algorithms to control the hardware. 
Through these components, a user will be able to easily incorporate a fully automated, 
intelligent home brewing system into their existing setup, as well as use our product 
as a framework to construct a new brewing system. The algorithms will control the 
hardware to influence the brewing process, creating a better product with each batch.
